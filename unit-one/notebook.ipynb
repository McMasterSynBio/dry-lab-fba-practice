    "## What is flux-balance analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flux-balance analysis is a predictive modeling method that is significantly used in systems biology. It has a wide variety of applications including (but not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Media optimization for the culture\n",
    "2. Finding knock-out targets\n",
    "3. Understanding metabolic constraints\n",
    "4. Neuroscience\n",
    "5. Biomanufacturing\n",
    "6. Cancer Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Many iGEM teams have cited [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1614) to explain how flux-balance analysis works. In a nutshell, it derives from the idea that reactions and metabolites in a metabolism can be represented as a matrix by the following **example:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an arbitrary reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2Na + 2HCl \\rightarrow 2NaCl + H_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reaction can be represented as a column vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -2 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each item represents the coefficient consumed/produced of that metabolite in the reaction. This principle applied to thousands of metabolites and reactions, and we get a linear optimization problem formulated as $Sv = 0$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S \\in R^{M \\times N}$ represents the stoichiometric matrix with each column a reaction, and each row a metabolite.\n",
    "- $v \\in R^{N}$ represents the fluxes (rates) of reactions, usually in units $mmol/gDW/h$ (biomass reactions are usually in $1/h$). \n",
    "- an assumption is made that the metabolic network is at steady-state, where each metabolite is consumed and produced at the same amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a metabolite concentration $[x]$ with the corresponding coefficient $s_i$ in the $i^{th}$ reaction, and $t$ for time, an equivalent formulation of the problem would be $$ \\sum_{i=1}^N s_i v_i = \\frac{d[x]}{dt} = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For more advanced analyses, flux-balance analysis pairs with [multiomics data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics) which can introduce more information such as genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are genome-scale metabolic models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMM or GEM for short) are formatted data files that contains all the essential information of the metabolism \n",
    "of an organism. Not only the set of reactions and metabolites, but they hold much more information such as gene associations (for turning on/off phenotypes), model compartments, flux constraints, etc. Development of comprehensive and accurate GSMMs for non-model organisms is one of the greatest bottlenecks of systems biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most GSMMs are published and used in the file format called SBML, which stands for **systems biology markup language**. However, the JSON file format, originally created for data transfer in web software applications, is also used for a similar purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The COBRA Toolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "The [iJO1366](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models/iJO1366) model was developed to mimic the metabolism of *Escherichia coli*. In the following practice, you'll be introduced to the basics of the python library COBRApy that is used to compile these models and run very basic forms of flux-balance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "First start off by installing COBRApy and making necessary imports into the notebook."
